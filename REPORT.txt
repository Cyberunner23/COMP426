This project uses GLFW instead of GLUT as the library since I am more comfortable with it.

The main thread starts by creating the window. It then initializes a certain amount of balls defined by the command like argument.
The balls are created with random position, velocity, mass and color.
When the ball is created, there is a check to see if it collides with any other ball, if it is the case, a new random ball is generated until no collision is detected.

The main thread then goes into the main loop.
It starts by doing frame limiting that is done by comparing the frame start times between the current frame and the previous frame.
The main thread then sleep until the total frame time elapsed is 1/30 of a second.

The main thread then does the updating using CUDA with 1 block and a thread per ball.

The main thread then does the collision handling.
The actual collision calculation uses elastic collision formulas.

After that it renders the balls based on their position and color.

A note on the additional files.

GLUtils.hpp:
  This file contains utilities I have created for drawing the background and the circle.
  These functions could have been put in the main file but I put them there for cleanliness.

BallUtils.hpp:
  This file contains utilities I created for the balls themselves. \
  It contains the data representing the ball, ball collision detection, ball generation as well as the update function used in the threads.
