The way I designed this is with a main thread and a computation thread per ball.

The main thread does the update logic, which consists of starting the threads for the ball updates, collision resolution and rendering.
The computation threads does the ball update, which consists of computing the position for the next frame.

I optimized by having the motion computations in the threads.
